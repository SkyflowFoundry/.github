# Skyflow Foundry

A community space for exploring the possibilities of privacy engineering with Skyflow.

## Guide

Have a look around at the sample projects and walkthroughs available in this organization. Everything here is open source and officially unsupported, so be mindful before deploying to production. And when you're ready, contribute some code by checking out the issues on a repo and see if you can help.

We have everything from a guide to integrating a privacy Vault into a GraphQL API with Apollo and Skyflow, to an example of creating privacy-enhancing UDFs for the Oracle DB, as well as advanced walkthroughs of orchestrating metadata updates via GitHub Actions.

Or, if you have new ideas but aren't sure how to get started, head over to the [ideas board](/ideas_board#issues).
